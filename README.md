# EVOK

_Evok_ is a tool that allows to record the history of physical objects (elements) that evolve over time. Assisting to ensure a coherent input of data and providing options to visualise it. 

In other words, it's an app that facilitates you the job of capturing the data of a living thing or an object, whatever changes in time, with some key features such as a camera implementation, a storage system, a timeline display etc.


Say you have a plant; you start growing it since day one, and would like to keep track of how it grows, how much sun is needed, how it looks...

The idea of Evok is similar to a Timelapse, with the idea of _lapsing_, which basically means to view the accumulated frames as it was animated, overlapped one after the other in a faster speed.

The examples below are likely scenarious in which _Evok_ can come in handy, and can help you understand better its full potential:

## EVOK USE CASES

- Growing plant (tree, flower...)
- A human's face (like a baby until it's adulthood)
- An ongoing building contruction
- A landspape
- A wound (imagine you could see how your wound heals in time with an animation)
- The evolving height of a child
- The evolution of a fat person loosing weight
- ...

> Say you'd like to __take selfie a day__, for the next ten years, or better yet, until you die. 

>That would require a lot of determination, organisational skill and patience. In this case Evok helps:
>-  provide a singular storage location (for all the picures you will be taking for the next decades)
>- An easy way to access and preview them as an animation
>- A simple quick way to take pictures and save them
>- A reminder feature
>- Tools to help you take each picture in a coherent way (ie. an __Onion Skin__ of the last picture shown on the camera, as you're about to take the next one)

>Imagine you want to keep track of your child's growth in many different aspects, you can:
>- keep track of his physical aspect through images
>- keep track of text format information (ie. height, weight, behaviour, diary...)
