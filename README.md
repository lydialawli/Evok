# EVOK

_Evok_ is a tool that allows to record the history of physical objects (elements) that evolve over time. Assisting to ensure a coherent input of data and providing options to visualise it. 

Some key features are: camera implementation (you can take pictures using the app), a storage system (everything will be stored localy, in the users device), a timeline display etc.


Say you have a plant; you start growing it since day one, and would like to keep track of how it grows, how much sun is needed, how it looks...

The idea of Evok is similar to a Timelapse, with the idea of _lapsing_, which basically means to view the accumulated frames as it was animated, overlapped one after the other in a faster speed.

The examples below are likely scenarious in which _Evok_ can come in handy, and can help you understand better its full potential:

## EVOK USE CASES

- Growing plant (tree, flower...)
- An ongoing building contruction
- A landspape
- The tummy of a pregnant woman (say for 9 months)
- A wound (imagine you could see how your wound heals in time with an animation)
- The evolution of a fat person loosing weight
- Say you'd like to __take selfie a day__, for the next ten years, or better yet, for as long as you're alive:
>That would require a lot of determination, organisational skill and patience. In this case Evok helps:
>-  provide a singular storage location (for all the picures you will be taking for the next decades)
>- An easy way to access and preview them as an animation
>- A simple quick way to take pictures and save them
>- A reminder feature
>- Tools to help you take each picture in a coherent way (ie. an __Onion Skin__ of the last picture shown on the camera, as you're about to take the next one)

- Imagine you want to keep the history of your __child's growth__ in many different aspects, you can:
>- keep track of his physical aspect through images
>- write a diary of the child (using text input)
>- Review all the history, in a organised and coherent way
>- And so on...



Evok is agnostic to what the app is used for.
